For a given pair of a and b : Consider a Chess board of a Ã— b squares.
Now, for each of the squares; Imagine a Queen standing on that square and compute
the number of squares under the queen's attack. Add all the numbers you get
for each of the a Ã— b possible queen's position and return it.

Examples :
    For a = 2 and b
     = 2 : squaresUnderQueenAttack(2,2) => 12.
    For a = 2 and b
     = 3 : squaresUnderQueenAttack(2,3) => 26."""
